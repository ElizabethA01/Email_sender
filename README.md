# Email_sender

This is an exercise from my Udemy course "Complete Python Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery". For this exercise, I created a code that send customisable emails without opening up the browser.

# My Thoughts

It was a very interesting exercise and I was able to link the python code to an HTML file where you can write a personalised email text.
